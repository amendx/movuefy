### Issues you might face

-  🍌 Lookout for those banana peels on the floor. If you've installed everything correctly and get an error like:

```shell
$ vue or jest is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
- **Don't worry**

> Just run this command: 
 - For Yarn
 
```shell
$ alias jest="~/AppData/Local/yarn/bin/jest"
``` 
or 

```shell
$ alias vue="~/AppData/Local/yarn/bin/vue"
```

  - This means you'll locally create an instance of vue cli or jest to run its internal commands 🚀
