### Adding Variables to your Environment

Don't forget to set up the variables! It allows us to have personalized configurations, but it also makes it easy to deploy our projects without having to store sensitive values in our codebase. If any doubt, read [this](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables/blob/master/README.md) article.

A config file is placed under (`~/config/dev.env.js`) or (`~/config/prod.env.js`)  and there can be placed the values of the variables. You can find the variables names and description on the file `.env.example`:  


```json
{
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY= < firebase project api key > 
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN= < firebase project api auth domain >
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_DB_URL= < firebase project api database url >
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID= < firebase api project id > 
    VUE_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET= < firebase api storage bucket >

    VUE_APP_MOVIEDB_API_KEY= < chave de api moviedb >
    VUE_APP_MOVIEDB_IMAGE_URL=< url de imagens >
}
```


> after that, feel free to run
```shell
$ npm start
```
> or if you want

```shell
$ yarn start
```



### Issues you might face

-  üçå Lookout for those banana peels on the floor. If you've installed everything correctly and get an error like:

```shell
$ vue or jest is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
- **Don't worry**

> Just run this command: 
 - For Yarn
 
```shell
$ alias jest="~/AppData/Local/yarn/bin/jest"
``` 
or 

```shell
$ alias vue="~/AppData/Local/yarn/bin/vue"
```

  - This means you'll locally create an instance of vue cli or jest to run its internal commands üöÄ
